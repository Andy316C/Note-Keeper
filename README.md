  <div id='install'>

  ## Installation
  The application required multiple npm packages for successfull deployment, the pacakages required were node.js , express and uuid. the express was used for the backend framework for node.js and uuid was used to create a custom ID for each note/task written down on the client side and saved in the backend db.json file.
